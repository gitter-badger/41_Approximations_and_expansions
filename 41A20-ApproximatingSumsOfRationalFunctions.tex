\begin{document}
Given a sum of the form $\sum_{m=n}^\infty f(m)$ where $f$ is a rational
function, it is possible to approximate it by approximating $f$ by another
rational function which can be summed in closed form.  Furthermore, the
approximation so obtained becomes better as $n$ increases.

We begin with a simple illustrative example.  Suppose that we want to sum
$\sum_{m=n}^\infty 1/m^2$.  We approximate $m^2$ by $m^2 - 1/4$, which 
factors as $(m+1/2)(m-1/2)$.  Then, upon separating the approximate summand
into partial fractions, the sum collapses:
\begin{align*}
 \sum_{m=n}^\infty {1 \over (m+1/2)(m-1/2)} 
   &= \sum_{m=n}^\infty \left( {1 \over m-1/2} - {1 \over m+1/2} \right) \\
   &= \sum_{m=n}^\infty {1 \over m-1/2} -
      \sum_{m=n+1}^\infty {1 \over m-1/2} \\
   &= {1 \over n-1/2}
\end{align*}

Using a similar approach, we may estimate the error of our approximation.
